defmodule Taskweft.Compose do
  @moduledoc """
  Composes several RECTGTN documents into one.

  `Taskweft.CLI` already merged one domain with one problem. That merge
  was private and pairwise, so a caller with three documents had no way
  to reach it. This module holds the same rules, makes them public, and
  folds any number of documents left to right.

  ## Why compose

  A pipeline that runs several models is several domains. Each one owns
  its own actions and its own guards, and each one is readable alone. A
  caller that wants the whole pipeline composes them, and the planner
  sees one document.

  The alternative is one large domain per pipeline. Two pipelines that
  share a stage then hold two copies of it, and the copies drift.

  ## The rules

  Later documents win, which makes the fold order meaningful.

  | Field | Rule |
  | ----- | ---- |
  | `variables` | Merge by `name`. The later one replaces. |
  | `actions` | Merge by key. The later one replaces. |
  | `methods` | Merge by key. The later one replaces. |
  | `goal_methods` | Merge by key. The later one replaces. |
  | `enums` | Merge by key. The later one replaces. |
  | `capabilities.graph.edges` | Concatenate. |
  | `capabilities.graph.definitions` | Merge by key. The later one replaces. |
  | `todo_list` | A non-empty list replaces. An empty one keeps. |
  | everything else | The first document's value stands. |

  A problem is an ordinary document under these rules. `compose/1` with
  a domain and its problem gives what the CLI pair gave before.

  ## Example

      iex> base = %{"@type" => "domain:Definition", "name" => "base",
      ...>          "actions" => %{"a_one" => %{"params" => []}}}
      iex> extra = %{"@type" => "domain:Definition", "name" => "extra",
      ...>           "actions" => %{"a_two" => %{"params" => []}}}
      iex> {:ok, merged} = Taskweft.Compose.compose([base, extra])
      iex> Map.keys(merged["actions"]) |> Enum.sort()
      ["a_one", "a_two"]

  nothing has no `name` and no `@type`, and the planner rejects it later

  Composes documents given as source strings.

  `format` takes `"dsl"` for the Elixir DSL, and `"json"` for JSON-LD.
  Returns the composed document as a JSON string, which is what the
  planner takes.

  `:base_format` gives the first document a format of its own. A caller
  that already parsed the base to JSON, and holds the overlays in the
  caller's format, needs that. Without it every document uses `format`.
